## Unhandled Promise Rejection in React Native Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates a bug in a React Native application where an unhandled promise rejection occurs during data fetching from a remote API. The issue is particularly prevalent on Android devices and can lead to app crashes. The problem is intermittent, making debugging challenging.  The solution involves implementing robust error handling and ensuring all promises are properly handled, regardless of success or failure.

This example uses a `fetch` call, but the issue could arise with other asynchronous operations as well. The solution focuses on thorough error handling within the `useEffect` hook and provides a better user experience by displaying informative error messages to the user.
